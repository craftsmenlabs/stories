## Source is the section where you declare your input API.
source:
    type: jira                                                # The type source of your application. Currently jira, trello or github

    jira:
        url: http://jira-url-here.net                         # URL to your JIRA environment
        project-key: GAR                                      # Your project key
        auth-key: KEY                                         # Basic auth key. Base64 encoded string of {username}:{password}
    trello:
        url:                                                  # URL to your Trello environment
        token:
        auth-key:
        project-key:
    github:
        url:                                                  # URL to the GitHub API
        project-key:                                          # Name of your project repository
        auth-key:                                             # GitHub username of the owner of the repository
        token:                                                # Personal access token of the owner



## The ouput data needs to be sent somewhere. There are multiple options available.
report:
  dashboard:
    enabled: false
    url: http://localhost:8090
    token:
  file:
    enabled: false
    location: /path/to/file

## Filters define what information we should use to filter the issues.
filters:
    status: "To Do"

## JIRA Agile uses custom fields to store some information it needs.
## To use the Storynator to it's full potential, you should create additional fields that represent the different data of the issue.
field-mapping:
    rank: "customfield_11400"
                                  # The rank field present in all issue types. Used for the curved ranking
    feature:
        estimation: "customfield_11402"
        acceptance-criteria: "customfield_11403"
    bug:
        reproduction-path: "customfield_13001"
        software: "customfield_13002"
        expected-behavior: "customfield_13003"
        acceptation-criteria: "customfield_13004"
    epic:
        goal: "customfield_13005"

## Defines what parts of the validation are active. General ones are:
##
## rating-threshold: The amount of points needed for a SUCCESS rating. 0-100 for backlog and 0-1 for everything else
## fill-fields: Determine score based on those fields filled.
## active: Whether you want to enable this or not
